basics: 
    JDK , JRE , JVM 
    WHY 
    when 
    where 
    data types 
    operators 
    class and Objects 
    Oops : 
        Inheritance 
            single, multi  ,Hyrihy ,
             hybrid , multiple,
        Polymorphism 
            compile time 
                overloding ; 
                    constructor over oding 
                    method over loding 
                    
            run time 
                    Ovr riding 
                        constro : no possbil 
                        method over loding 
        Abstraction 
            hiding the implemantation ,
             by making methods abstract 
            if mthod is abstract the my class also must abstract
            we cant a bale to create a object 
            the wehave to over ride in sub class 
            
            2 ways : 
                abstract class : 0-100% 
                interface  : 100% 
        Encupulation 
            binding the data into single unit :
            how? 
                make all varablis as priavet
                using setter and getter 
            Eception Handling : 
                compile time : checked :
                    FileNotFOund 
                    SQL Exception 
                run time  : unchecked 
                    AE
                    NPE
